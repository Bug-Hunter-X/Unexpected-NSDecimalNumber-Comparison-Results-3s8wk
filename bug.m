In Objective-C, a subtle issue can arise when dealing with `NSDecimalNumber` and its comparison methods.  The `compare:` method returns `NSComparisonResult`, an enum which is not directly comparable with standard boolean operators. This might lead to unexpected behavior if a direct comparison is attempted (e.g., `if ([decimal1 compare:decimal2] == NSOrderedSame) { ... }` works, but a mistake like `if ([decimal1 compare:decimal2] == YES) { ... }` will likely lead to unexpected behavior because `YES` is equivalent to 1 and other comparison results are represented by different integers).
